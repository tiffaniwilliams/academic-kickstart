I am the director of our new iCAN program, which begins in Fall 2020.  iCAN is a one-year accelerator for college graduates, who graduated in any major besides computer science, to gain fundamental computing skills. iCAN serves as an innovative pathway to a tech career in industry or graduate studies in computer science.
